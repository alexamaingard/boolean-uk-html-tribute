      <h2>Acting Career</h2>

        In 2000, Momsen played the role of Cindy Lou Who in Dr. Seuss' How the
        Grinch Stole Christmas, her breakout role. In 2002, she played Gretel in
        Hansel and Gretel and Alexandra, the President's daughter, in Spy Kids
        2: The Island of Lost Dreams. Momsen's career came to a halt for over
        three years until she received a lead role in the WB series
        Misconceptions, which never aired. After that, she also appeared in the
        2006 film Saving Shiloh. She also auditioned for the title role in
        Hannah Montana, and was in the top three, but the role was instead
        awarded to Miley Cyrusâ€”a decision that Momsen was happy with in
        retrospect. In 2007, she starred in the Walt Disney Pictures film
        Underdog as Molly and as Jennifer in the movie Paranoid Park, directed
        by Gus Van Sant. Beginning in 2007, she played the character of Jenny
        Humphrey in The CW television series Gossip Girl, based on the book
        series by Cecily von Ziegesar. Momsen's appearances on the series became
        increasingly sporadic, and, by the end of the first half of the fourth
        season, she had only appeared in four episodes. It was then announced
        that the actress would be scheduled for an indefinite hiatus from the
        show, which ended with her leaving the series as a regular cast member
        after the completion of the fourth season in 2011. On August 16, 2011,
        Momsen told Elle magazine that she had quit acting to focus on her music
        career. On October 16, 2012, it was reported that Momsen would be
        returning to Gossip Girl for its final episode, in which she appeared
        briefly in the wedding sequence.

        In June 2008, at the age of fourteen, Momsen signed to IMG Models. She
        was the face of British fashion chain New Look for its spring/summer
        2010 collection. After weeks of speculation about who would be the face
        of Madonna's 2010 fashion line "Material Girl", Momsen was announced on
        July 15, 2010. A week later, Momsen was announced as the model for John
        Galliano's new women's fragrance, scheduled to launch in autumn 2010. In
        2010, she appeared in a video for Galliano's "Parlez-Moi d'Amour"
        fragrance ad campaign. Momsen is the face of Samantha Thavasa's handbag
        line. She has done multiple photoshoots, press events, and commercials.
        Momsen appeared on the cover of Page Six Magazine when she was 15 years
        old in 2009. She also appeared on the February 2010 cover of Seventeen.
        In October 2010, Momsen wore a pair of platform stilettos, thigh-high
        stockings, and a holster strapped around her leg for Revolver. She
        appeared on the cover of FHM's March 2012 edition and FHM ranked Momsen
        #29 in its 2012 Hot 100 issue. She also made her cover debut for Maxim
        in the November 2013 issue. In an interview with music journalist Jason
        Tanamor, when asked about posing for Playboy, she said, "I was at the
        mansion last week and took some pictures. Does that count?"

        The Pretty Reckless is an American rock band from New York City, formed
        in 2009. The band consists of Taylor Momsen (lead vocals, rhythm
        guitar), Ben Phillips (lead guitar, backing vocals), Mark Damon (bass),
        and Jamie Perkins (drums). The band released their debut studio album,
        Light Me Up, in August 2010. The album spawned three moderately
        successful singles, most notably "Make Me Wanna Die". The band released
        the Hit Me Like a Man EP in early 2012. In March 2014, the band released
        their second studio album, Going to Hell, which included the singles
        "Heaven Knows" and "Messed Up World" which topped the US and UK rock
        charts. The band's third studio album, Who You Selling For, was released
        on October 21, 2016, by Razor & Tie. The album spawned the single "Take
        Me Down", which earned the band their fourth number one on the US rock
        chart. The band's fourth studio album, Death by Rock and Roll, was
        released on February 12, 2021.
